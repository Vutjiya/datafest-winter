    "# $k$-NN Module\n",
    "In this module, we introduce some fundamental concepts in machine learning (ML) while also introducing the $k$-NN model: one of the most basic non-parametric supervised learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea of the $k$-NN model is based on an idea popularized by Waldo Tobler: \"everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.\" Essentially, things that are closer to each other are more similar to each other. Using this idea gives us a method for prediction given that we have observed some data. Now let's formalize this idea further in this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $k$-NN algorithm uses those observations in the training set $\\mathcal{T}$ closest in feature space to a query point $x_0$ to form the prediction $\\hat{y}$. Specifically, the $k$-nearest neighbor classifier for $\\hat{y}$ is defined as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y}(x_0) = \\argmax_{c \\in \\mathcal{C}} \\sum_{x_i \\in \\mathcal{N}_k(x_0)} \\delta_{y_i, c}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{C}$ is the set of class labels, $\\mathcal{N}_k(x_0)$ is the neighborhood of $x_0$ defined by the $k$ closest points in $\\mathcal{T}$, and $\\delta_{y_i, c}$ is the *Kronecker delta*:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\delta_{y_i, c} = \n",
    "\\begin{cases} \n",
    "1 & \\text{if } y_i = c \\\\ \n",
    "0 & \\text{otherwise} \n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Closeness implies some notion of distance and a corresponding metric, which in our case we assume is the *$\\ell^2$ norm* (Euclidean distance). In words, given a query point $x_0$, we find the $k$ training observations closest to $x_0$ in feature space, and classify using majority vote among the $k$ neighbors. In the case of ties, they are broken at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've introduced some of the theory for $k$-NN, let's experiment with the model through a few exercises. The first section of this module is a dedicated tutorial to [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) that also teaches some basic ML concepts using $k$-NN as the motivating example.\n",

    "## $k$-NN Modeling\n",
    "After doing some EDA, we now need to pre-process the data before we can begin modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Normalizing Features\n",
    "Our first order of business is to normalize our features. Since the performance of $k$-NN is entirely dependent on a distance metric, it's important that our notion of distance is standardized across all our features. Otherwise, our features will be on different scales, which would induce a magnitude bias in our model. In other words, features that on average have higher values would dominate the model, marginalizing the effect of other features that have on average smaller values. Our strategy for standardizing will be to map values to a $[0, 1]$ range. This is also called [*min-max scaling*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling#Rescaling_(min-max_normalization)) and can be done by applying the following formula to each column in our dataset (excluding the class column):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X_{ij,\\text{normalized}} = \\frac{X_{ij} - X_{j,\\text{min}}}{X_{j,\\text{max}} - X_{j,\\text{min}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $X_{ij}$ is the value of the $i \\text{th}$ observation and $j\\text{th}$ feature. The programming for this is a bit involved, so fortunately [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) provides us with the [`MinMaxScaler`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) class. We simply need to create an instance of [`MinMaxScaler`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) and call the [`fit_transform`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html#sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.fit_transform) method on it, passing our features `X` as a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encoding Class Labels\n",
    "Next, we need to address the fact that machine learning models don't handle non-numeric data very well. Since our class labels are strings, we need to convert them to integer values. We'll use the following mapping:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "&\\text{Iris-setosa} \\to 0 \\\\\n",
    "&\\text{Iris-versicolor} \\to 1 \\\\\n",
    "&\\text{Iris-virginica} \\to 2\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Again, we don't need to do any of this manually. The [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) package provides the [`LabelEncoder`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder.html) class that handles this for us. All we need to do is call the [`fit_transform`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder.html#sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder.fit_transform) method on a [`LabelEncoder`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder.html) instance and pass our labels `y` as a parameter into the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train-Test Split\n",
    "Finally, we need to split the data into a ***training set*** and a ***test set*** (this is also known as the *holdout method*). As the names imply, the training set is the data we use to train our model, and the test set is the data we use to test our model. To create these two sets, we first shuffle the dataset to make sure that the order in which the observations appear do not affect the learning process. Next, we randomly partition our dataset into two disjoint subsets. It is essential that these two subsets are disjoint to prevent data leakage. Here, we will use a $70/30$ split (i.e., $70\\%$ of the observations will be in the training set and $30\\%$ in the test set). \n",
    "\n",
    "If this sounds like a lot, that's because it is! Fortunately, [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) provides the [`train_test_split`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html) function that handles all the troublesome logic for us. We simply pass in our features `X` and labels `y`, and specify the split size using either the `train_size` or `test_size` parameter. Additionally, we set the `random_state` parameter to `42` to ensure reproducibility. This guarantees that we get the same splits every time we run the code.\n",

    "The general process for developing supervised learning models is:\n",
    "1. Train the model on the training data\n",
    "2. Evaluate the model's performance on the test data\n",
    "3. If the model generalizes well on the test data, use the trained model for inference on new, unseen data\n",
    "\n",
    "In [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html), all ML models are called [*estimators*](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-estimator) (note: this is not to be confused with the notion of estimators from statistics). These estimators are implemented as classes that inherit from a *base estimator* class and use what is called a [*mixin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin) class to add specific functionality. For our purposes, since we are working in the classification setting, the models we will be using are subclasses of both the [`BaseEstimator`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.base.BaseEstimator.html) class and the [`ClassifierMixin`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.base.ClassifierMixin.html) class. The [`BaseEstimator`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.base.BaseEstimator.html) class provides core functionality like parameter management, while the [`ClassifierMixin`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.base.ClassifierMixin.html) adds classifier-specific methods such as [`score`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-score), which computes classification accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical workflow for using these estimators follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize the model**: Create an instance of the estimator class with the desired hyperparameters\n",
    "2. **Fit the model**: Train the model on the training data using the [`fit`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-fit) method\n",
    "3. **Evaluate the model**: Assess the model's performance on the test data using the [`score`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-score) method or other metrics (e.g. accuracy, precision, $R^2$, or $\\text{MSE}$)\n",
    "4. **Make predictions**: Use the trained model to predict labels on new data using the [`predict`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-predict) method\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, all [*classifiers*](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-classifier) that inherit from [`BaseEstimator`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.base.BaseEstimator.html) and [`ClassifierMixin`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.base.ClassifierMixin.html) must implement the [`fit`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-fit), [`score`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-score), and [`predict`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-predict) methods. This architecture helps ensure consistency across all classification models, as any classifier will have the same basic interface, making it easy to swap models or compare different approaches.\n",

    "We now focus on two separate but deeply intertwined concepts in ML: the bias-variance tradeoff and decision boundaries. These concepts are connected through how we evaluate model performance. The bias-variance tradeoff describes *why* models make errors, while decision boundaries provide a visual way to *observe* these errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "Recall from statistics that the mean squared error $\\text{(MSE)}$ for an estimator $\\hat{f}$ at a query point $x_0$ is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{MSE}(x_0) = \\mathbb{E}_\\mathcal{T}\\left[\\left(f(x_0) - \\hat{f}(x_0)\\right)^2\\right]\n",

    "With some algebra, the $\\text{MSE}$ can be decomposed into three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "The key insight is that there's a tradeoff: as we reduce the bias of our model, we typically increase its variance, and vice versa. Our goal is to find the model complexity that minimizes the total error (i.e., the $\\text{MSE}$). We should note that one way to think about ML is that we are trying to estimate some function $f$ that maps from our data $X$ to our class labels $Y$, where $f$ is some fixed, unknown function. As such, the goal of ML is to estimate this function using an estimator $\\hat{f}$. Since we are dealing with an estimator, we have all of the tools of statistics at our disposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Boundaries\n",
    "To understand how this tradeoff appears in practice, we turn to the concept of decision boundaries. Another way to think about ML is that we are trying to learn the shape of a *decision boundary*. A ***decision boundary*** is a hypersurface that partitions the feature space into regions, with each region corresponding to a particular class. Points on one side of the boundary are classified as one class, while points on the other side are classified as another. Here, a ***hypersurface*** is defined to be a generalization of the concepts of a hyperplane, plane curve, and surface. For points exactly on the decision boundary, the class label is ambiguous; the model is equally uncertain about which class to assign. In the simplest case with two features and binary classification, the decision boundary is a curve (or a line if the classification problem is *linear*). More generally, in $d$ dimensions, the decision boundary is a $(d-1)$-dimensional hypersurface. We consider a classification problem to be ***linear*** if and only if the decision boundary is a hyperplane, which also means the classes are ***linearly separable***. However, most real-world problems have non-linear decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision boundaries provide a visual tool for understanding the bias-variance tradeoff. To investigate this phenomenon for the $k$-NN algorithm, we'll use decision boundaries as a visual diagnostic. Below, we create a synthetic binary classification problem and generate decision boundaries for various values of $k$. Run the code chunk below and answer the questions that follow.\n",

For both plots, vary $k$ from $1$ to $101$ using only odd numbers $(1, 3, \\ldots, 101)$. This process is known as *hyperparameter tuning* (granted, a pretty rudimentary way of doing it). To account for variability, train a $k$-NN model $20$ times for each value of $k$.

    "# Curse of Dimensionality\n",
    "Since the $k$-NN algorithm is entirely dependent on distance, any issues that arise when working in higher-dimensional spaces will directly affect the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this simulation, we'll demonstrate the ***curse of dimensionality***. In the context of ML, this phenomenon occurs when we have a fixed number of training examples but an increasing number of dimensions in the feature space. As the number of dimensions increase, data points become increasingly sparse, making it difficult for distance-based methods like $k$-NN to find meaningful nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this, we'll examine the relationship between a unit *hypercube* and its inscribed unit *hypersphere* as we increase the number of dimensions. Specifically, we'll estimate what proportion of the hypercube's volume is occupied by the inscribed hypersphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first, a few definitions: \n",
    "- We define a ***hypercube*** to be a $p$-dimensional analogue of a cube. When $p = 1$, a hypercube is simply a line segment; when $p = 2$, it's a square; and when $p = 100$, it's a $100$-dimensional cube. \n",
    "- Similarly, we define a ***hypersphere*** to be a $p$-dimensional analogue of a sphere. When $p = 1$, a hypersphere is a line segment; when $p = 2$, it's a circle; and in higher dimensions, it generalizes accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that out of the way, let's get to the actual experiment! Write a simulation that implements the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "FOR p = 1 to p_MAX:\n",
    "    // Generate random points uniformly in unit hypercube\n",
    "    // Calculate distance from origin for each point\n",
    "    // Determine which points fall inside unit hypersphere\n",
    "    // Calculate proportion of points inside hypersphere\n",
    "END FOR\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to plot the results of your simulation and to set the `seed` parameter for `default_rng` to be `67` to ensure reproducibility. Once you've finished your implementation, answer the following questions:\n",

    "---\n",

    "---\n",
