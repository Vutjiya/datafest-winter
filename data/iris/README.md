The task is to classify flowers as setosa, versicolor, or virginica based on their physical characteristics.

**Variables**:

| Variable Name | Type | Description |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `sepal_length` | Continuous | Length of the sepal in centimeters |
| `sepal_width` | Continuous | Width of the sepal in centimeters |

| `petal_width` | Continuous | Width of the petal in centimeters |
| `species` | Categorical | Species of iris flower (setosa, versicolor, virginica) |
