# Palmer Penguins Dataset

**Source**: [Palmer Penguins Dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/index.html)

**Description**: This dataset contains size measurements, clutch observations, and blood isotope ratios for $344$ adult foraging penguins from three species observed on islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica, with $16$ variables. Data were collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program between $2007$ and $2009$ to study Antarctic penguins' foraging behavior and its relationship with environmental variability. The task is to classify penguins as Adelie, Chinstrap, or Gentoo based on their physical characteristics.
