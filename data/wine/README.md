# Wine Dataset

**Source**: [Wine Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine)

**Description**: This dataset contains the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars, with $178$ total observations and $14$ variables. The dataset was created by Stefan Aeberhard and M. Forina and donated in $1991$. The task is to classify wines into one of three cultivars based on their chemical properties.
